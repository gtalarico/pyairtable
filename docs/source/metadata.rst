Metadata
========

.. versionadded:: 1.0.0

These functions give you the ability to list all bases your access token can read as well as retrieve the schema (tables, fields, and views) for a given base.

.. warning::
    The Metadata API previously required specific registration with Airtable.
    As of `November 2022 <https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/changelog#anchor-2022-11-15>`_, any developer can use these methods when authenticating
    with a Personal Access or OAuth token (with the correct `scopes <https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes>`_).
